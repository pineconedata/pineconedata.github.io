Today we'll demonstrate how to determine the relationship between metrics and generate visualizations. This is the fourth part of a series that walks through the entire process of a data science project - from initial steps like data acquisition, preprocessing, and cleaning to more advanced steps like feature engineering, machine learning, and creating visualizations. 

As a reminder, the dataset we'll be using in this project contains individual basketball player statistics (such as total points scored and blocks made) for the 2023-2024 NCAA women's basketball season. Here's a brief description of each major step that we'll go through for this project: 

![the steps for this data science project](/assets/img/posts/2024-04-11-basketball-data-acquisition/ncaa_wbb_project_steps.png "the steps for this data science project")

1. **Data Acquisition** - This initial step involves obtaining data from two sources: (1) exporting the NCAA's online individual player statistics report and (2) making API requests to the Yahoo Sports endpoint. 
2. **Data Cleaning** - This step focuses on identifying and correcting any errors within the dataset. This includes removing duplicates, correcting inaccuracies, and handling missing data. 
3. **Data Preprocessing** - This step ensures the data is suitable for analysis by converting datatypes, standardizing units, and replacing abbreviations.
4. **Feature Engineering** - This step involves selecting and expanding upon the dataset's features (or columns). This includes calculating additional metrics from existing columns.
5. **Creating Visualizations** - This step involves identifying the relationships between various parameters (such as height and blocked shots) and generating meaningful visualizations (such as bar charts, scatterplots, and candlestick charts).
6. **Machine Learning** - This step focuses on training a machine learning model to identify the combination of individual player statistics that correlates with optimal performance. 

We'll use Python along with the popular [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) and [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) libraries to acquire the data efficiently. By the end of this series, you'll be equipped with the skills needed to gather raw data from online sources, structure it into a usable format, eliminate any inconsistencies and errors, create meaningful visualizations, and train a basic machine learning model. Since we already gathered the raw data from online sources in [Part 1](/2024-04-11-basketball-data-acquisition/), cleaned that data in [Part 2](2024-05-02-basketball-data-cleaning-preprocessing/), and engineered new features in [Part 3](/2024-05-30-basketball-feature_engineering/), we're ready to move on to generating visualizations.

# Getting Started
Since this is the fourth installment in the series, you likely already have your environment setup and can skip to the next section. If you're not already set up and you want to follow along on your own machine, it's recommended to read the [first article of the series](/2024-04-11-basketball-data-acquisition/) or at least review the [Getting Started](/2024-04-11-basketball-data-acquisition/#getting-started) section of that post before continuing. 

## Import Packages
You'll want to have the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed with the following packages: 
  - [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
  - [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  - [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html)
  - [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)
  - [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/)
  - [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
  - [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
  - [plotly](https://plotly.com/)
  - [scipy](https://scipy.org/https://scipy.org/)
  
For today's visualizations specifically, we'll want to import most of these libraries: 


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.io as pio
import scipy
```

Since I'm creating these graphs using [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/), I'll also make sure the jupyterlab-plotly extension is installed and will specify that my plotly charts should display as an iframe. 


```python
pio.renderers.default = 'iframe'
```

## Import Data
In [Part 3](/2024-05-30-basketball-feature_engineering/) of this series, we engineered new features for our dataset, which is stored in a dataframe named `player_data`. If you want to follow along with the code examples in this article, it's recommended to import the `player_data` dataframe before proceeding. 


```python
player_data = pd.read_excel('player_data_engineered.xlsx')
player_data.head()
```

### Note about Graphing Packages
The example visualizations in this article use multiple graphing packages: [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and the [pandas DataFrame plot() method](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html) (which uses matplotlib under the hood by default). Each of these graphing packages has strengths and weaknesses that could be the subject of an entire article. We could create all of our visualizations with just one of those three graphing packages (seaborn, matplotlib, plotly), but we'll use a little bit of all three today. 

Here's a quick example of a scatterplot created with the same data using each graphing package. 


```python
plt.scatter(x=player_data['FIELD_GOALS_MADE'], y=player_data['POINTS'])
plt.title('Matplotlib Scatterplot')
plt.show()
```


    
![png](/assets/img/posts/2024-07-29-basketball-visualizations/output_8_0.png)
    



```python
player_data.plot.scatter(x='FIELD_GOALS_MADE', y='POINTS', title='pandas Scatterplot (matplotlib backend)')
plt.show()
```


    
![png](/assets/img/posts/2024-07-29-basketball-visualizations/output_9_0.png)
    



```python
sns.scatterplot(player_data, x='FIELD_GOALS_MADE', y='POINTS').set_title('Seaborn Scatterplot')
plt.show()
```


    
![png](/assets/img/posts/2024-07-29-basketball-visualizations/output_10_0.png)
    



```python
fig = px.scatter(player_data, x='FIELD_GOALS_MADE', y='POINTS', title='Plotly Scatterplot')
fig.show()
```

We can see that each graph is displaying the same dataset, but the syntax and default formatting for each one differs slightly. 

## Set Graph Preferences
This is an entirely optional step to configure the aesthetics of the graphs and charts. You can import a custom color scheme or set colors individually. In this case, we'll define a list of custom colors (`graph_colors`) and configure both Matplotlib and Seaborn to use these colors for subsequent plots.


```python
graph_colors = ['#615EEA', '#339E7A', '#ff8c6c']
plt.rcParams['axes.prop_cycle'] = plt.cycler(color=graph_colors)
sns.set_palette(graph_colors)
```

We can also set the overall style for the matplotlib plots using a style sheet. You can print the list of available style sheets and view examples of these style sheets [on matplotlib's website](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/style_sheets/style_sheets_reference.html).


```python
print(plt.style.available)
```

    ['Solarize_Light2', '_classic_test_patch', '_mpl-gallery', '_mpl-gallery-nogrid', 'bmh', 'classic', 'dark_background', 'fast', 'fivethirtyeight', 'ggplot', 'grayscale', 'seaborn-v0_8', 'seaborn-v0_8-bright', 'seaborn-v0_8-colorblind', 'seaborn-v0_8-dark', 'seaborn-v0_8-dark-palette', 'seaborn-v0_8-darkgrid', 'seaborn-v0_8-deep', 'seaborn-v0_8-muted', 'seaborn-v0_8-notebook', 'seaborn-v0_8-paper', 'seaborn-v0_8-pastel', 'seaborn-v0_8-poster', 'seaborn-v0_8-talk', 'seaborn-v0_8-ticks', 'seaborn-v0_8-white', 'seaborn-v0_8-whitegrid', 'tableau-colorblind10']



```python
plt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-white')
```

That's all the setup steps needed, so we're ready to move on to identifying the relationships between various variables in our dataset.

# Identify Relationships between Variables
In this section, we'll explore the dataset to understand relationships between various parameters. We'll use the [pandas `describe()` function](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.describe.html) for a statistical summary, create a correlation matrix to visualize variable relationships, and generate a pairwise plot for a detailed view. This analysis will help us identify patterns and help us select meaningful visualizations for this data science project.

## Describe the Dataset
The first step is to get a statistical summary of our dataset. The `describe()` function in pandas provides a high-level statistical summary for each numerical column of our dataset, including: 

1. Count - The number of non-null entries in a column.
2. Mean - The average value of all entries in a column.
3. Standard Deviation - A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of the entries in a column.
4. Minimum - The smallest entry in a column.
5. 25th percentile - The value below which a quarter of the entries in a column fall.
6. Median - The middle value in a column when the entries are sorted in ascending or descending order.
7. 75th percentile - The value below which three quarters of the entries in a column fall.
8. Maximum - The largest entry in a column.


```python
player_data.describe()
```

This gives an understanding of the distribution of data and characteristics of each column. This helps us identify any outliers or missing data, as well as assess how spread out the data is. It's often recommended to take a few minutes to scan through the statistics for each column to get a better understanding of each one and to quickly check for any issues. For example, you might notice that the `count` for the `THREE_POINT_PERCENTAGE` column is lower than the other columns. If you've read [Part 2](https://www.pineconedata.com/2024-05-02-basketball-data-cleaning-preprocessing/#handle-missing-three-point-percentages) of this series, you might remember that some rows are missing a three point percentage in cases where a player had zero three point goals attempted, so it makes sense that the `count` of non-null `THREE_POINT_PERCENTAGE` rows is `841` instead of `900`. 

## Define Numerical Columns (Feature Selection)
Next, itâ€™d be helpful to generate a few charts to explore the relationships between the various player statistics. However, including too many metrics can slow down the plot generation process, so let's limit the number of numerical columns. (To be clear, this step is entirely optional and it is possible to generate a plot with all of these columns.)

But how do we choose the right columns? This is often an entire step of a data science project and is referred to as [feature selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_selection). There are plenty of feature selection methods, but identifying which features are best often depends on your specific use case. For example,  if youâ€™re developing a machine learning model that optimizes for defensive players, you might want to include features such as steals, blocks, and rebounds. However, if youâ€™re optimizing for offensive players, then you might focus on features like points and assists. Other features, such as turnovers and fouls, might be included in both cases. 

For todayâ€™s purpose, we donâ€™t have a specific use-case in mind and are instead more focused on exploring the dataset and creating interesting visualizations. So, letâ€™s make an educated guess on some features that might be similar enough to choose a few of them. For example, for each points metric (two-point goals, three-point goals, total field goals, and free throws) there are three columns (goals made, goals attempted, and goal percentage). 


```python
player_data[['PLAYER_NAME', 'TWO_POINTS_MADE', 'TWO_POINT_ATTEMPTS', 'TWO_POINT_PERCENTAGE']].head()
```

These columns are distinct and we already suspect that they are interrelated. The goal percentage is directly calculated by dividing goals made by goals attempted, so we likely donâ€™t need to include that for each metric. The number of goals made is likely related to the number of goals attempted (you cannot score a goal without attempting it), so we could use just one of those two columns as a proxy in todayâ€™s visualizations. You can use either, but since goals made is directly used in the calculation for fantasy points, letâ€™s go with that one. 

In summary, we can collapse the goals made, goals attempted, and goal percentage columns down into just the goals made columns. Using similar logic, we can include total rebounds (excluding offensive and defensive rebounds), minutes played (instead of games played), and remove certain calculated columns (like the per-game metrics and assist-to-turnover ratio). This dramatically reduces the number of numerical columns for these initial exploratory plots while still preserving critical features.

Here's the final list of numerical columns we'll use for the first few visualizations: 


```python
numerical_columns = ['Height', 'MINUTES_PLAYED', 'FIELD_GOALS_MADE', 
                     'THREE_POINTS_MADE', 'TWO_POINTS_MADE', 'FREE_THROWS_MADE',
                     'TOTAL_REBOUNDS', 'ASSISTS', 'TURNOVERS', 
                     'STEALS', 'BLOCKS', 'FOULS', 'POINTS', 'FANTASY_POINTS']
```

## Generate Correlation Matrix

A [correlation matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation#Correlation_matrices) is a table showing the correlation coefficients between many variables. Each cell in the table shows the correlation between two variables. The value is in the range of -1 to 1 and each cell color indicates the strength and direction of the correlation between two variables. If two variables have a high correlation, it means that when one variable changes, the other variable tends to also change in a specific direction. Values closer to zero indicate a weak correlation, where a change in one variable does not correlate with a change in the other variable. 

### Correlation vs Causation
Note that [correlation does not imply causation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation). Just because there is a statistical association between two variables does not mean that a change in one variable actually *causes* a change in the other variable. There is an entire website containing [spurious correlations](https://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations), but here's one example of two variables that are strongly correlated, but are unlikely to have a cause-and-effect relationship: the divorce rate in Maine and the per capita consumption of margarine. 

![correlation does not imply causation](https://tylervigen.com/spurious/correlation/image/5920_per-capita-consumption-of-margarine_correlates-with_the-divorce-rate-in-maine.svg "correlation does not imply causation")

So keep in mind that correlation is not the same as causation. That said, knowing which variables are correlated with each other is still useful for this project. By examining the correlation matrix, we can identify which statistics tend to increase or decrease together, which can give us insights about the data. This can be particularly useful for feature selection in machine learning models, as it helps to avoid situations where multiple features are highly correlated with each other ([multicollinearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity)).

Before creating the full correlation matrix with all of the numerical columns, let's take a quick look at a correlation matrix that only includes two metrics that we already suspect are correlated: field goals made and field goals attempted. We'll use the [pandas `corr()` method](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.corr.html) to create the correlation matrix itself and then use a [Seaborn heatmap](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html) to visualize it.


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
correlation_matrix = player_data[['FIELD_GOALS_MADE', 'FIELD_GOAL_ATTEMPTS']].corr()
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt=".2f", linewidths=0.5)
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap of Player Statistics')
plt.show()
```


    
![png](/assets/img/posts/2024-07-29-basketball-visualizations/output_28_0.png)
    


The simplest example of a strong correlation in the correlation matrix is the one-to-one relationship, where the values across one diagonal show the correlation of a variable with itself, so the correlation coefficient is exactly 1. Here we can see that the correlation coefficient between field goals attempted and field goals made is `0.91`. This is pretty close to `1.00`, so these two variables are strongly correlated. As one value goes up, the other is also likely to go up, and vice versa. 

You might also notice that we only need half of this matrix - either the half above the diagonal line of `1.00` values or the half below the diagonal line. The diagonal line of correlation coefficients show the one to one relationship between each metric and itself - for example, the top-left square shows the relationship between `FIELD_GOALS_MADE` and `FIELD_GOALS_MADE` (itself). The correlation coefficients in the bottom-left and the top-right squares are identical, since both of them show the relationship between `FIELD_GOAL_ATTEMPTS` and `FIELD_GOALS_MADE`. To see this point illustrated a bit more clearly, we can add two more pairings of similar metrics: two pointers made and two pointers attempted. 


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
correlation_matrix = player_data[['FIELD_GOALS_MADE', 'FIELD_GOAL_ATTEMPTS', 'TWO_POINTS_MADE', 'TWO_POINT_ATTEMPTS']].corr()
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt=".2f", linewidths=0.5)
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap of Player Statistics')
plt.show()
```


    
![png](/assets/img/posts/2024-07-29-basketball-visualizations/output_30_0.png)
    


Just like the previous matrix, we can see that there's a diagonal line of `1.00` values and the values are mirrored across that diagonal line of `1.00` values. The correlation coefficient between two pointers made and two pointers attempted is even stronger (`0.95`) than field goals made and attempted, so these two values are also strongly correlated. Now that we understand a bit more about correlation matrices, we're ready to create the full chart. 


```python
correlation_matrix = player_data[numerical_columns].corr()
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt=".2f", linewidths=0.5)
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap of Player Statistics')
plt.show()
```


    
![png](/assets/img/posts/2024-07-29-basketball-visualizations/output_32_0.png)
    


This is a really useful visual that we'll be referring back to when we decide which variable pairings to use for visualizations.  

## Generate Scatterplot Matrix
To explore the relationships between variables, we can create a scatterplot matrix as well (also known as a pairwise plot). A scatterplot matrix is a collection of scatterplots organized into a grid. Each scatterplot shows the relationship between a pair of variables. The diagonal cells show a histogram of the variable corresponding to that row/column. By organizing these scatterplots into a matrix, we can easily compare multiple variables and observe potential correlations between different pairs of variables at a glance. 

This method is particularly useful because it allows us to visualize the relationships between two variables, similar to the correlation matrix, but provides more detail by showing a scatterplot instead of a single number (the correlation coefficient). This makes it easier to visualize the interaction between variables. Just like the correlation matrix, this is useful for feature selection and deciding which variables to include in subsequent data analysis or machine learning models. 

We can create a scatterplot matrix with our smaller list of numerical columns using [Seaborn's `pairplot()` function](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.pairplot.html). 


```python
sns.pairplot(player_data[numerical_columns])
plt.show()
```


    
![png](/assets/img/posts/2024-07-29-basketball-visualizations/output_35_0.png)
    


Looking at this chart, you can see why we reduced the number of numerical columns. Scatterplot matrices can get quite large with too many variables, so it can be helpful to focus on a few variables at first and individually analyze additional variables later. For example, the scatterplot matrix shows a dense linear relationship between `POINTS` and `FIELD_GOALS_MADE` and this matches the 0.97 correlation coefficient from the previous chart. Just like the correlation matrix, we can refer to back to this scatterplot matrix to quickly check the relationship between variables. 

# Generate Visualizations
Now that we've explored the relationships between our variables a bit, let's create a few visualizations. We'll cover a scatterplot, stacked bar chart, heatmap, violin plot, joint plot, and a histogram.

## Scatterplot of Field Goals Made vs Points
First, let's plot a scatterplot of field goals made versus points. This will illustrate the relationship between the number of field goals a player makes and the total points they score.


```python
plt.scatter(player_data['FIELD_GOALS_MADE'], player_data['POINTS'], label='Player')
plt.xlabel('Field Goals Made')
plt.ylabel('Points')
plt.title('Field Goals Made vs Points')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```


    
![png](/assets/img/posts/2024-07-29-basketball-visualizations/output_39_0.png)
    


### Add Line of Best Fit to Scatterplot
Since this looks like a linear relationship, we can also add a line of best fit to the scatterplot, which is a straight line that attempts to closely match the trend of the data on the scatter plot. This line may pass through some of the points, none of the points, or all of the points. This will give us a visual representation (as well as a mathematical formula) of the correlation between the number of field goals made and the total points. We can calculate the line of best fit using scipy's [linregress](https://docs.scipy.org/doc//scipy-1.10.1/reference/generated/scipy.stats.linregress.html) function: 


```python
slope, intercept, r_value, p_value, std_err = scipy.stats.linregress(player_data['FIELD_GOALS_MADE'], player_data['POINTS'])
x_values = np.array([min(player_data['FIELD_GOALS_MADE']), max(player_data['FIELD_GOALS_MADE'])])
y_values = slope * x_values + intercept
print(f"Equation of the trend line: y = {slope:.2f}x + {intercept:.2f}")
```

    Equation of the trend line: y = 2.65x + 10.96


Now that we've calculated the line of best fit, we can add it to the scatterplot: 


```python
plt.scatter(player_data['FIELD_GOALS_MADE'], player_data['POINTS'], label='Player')
plt.plot(x_values, y_values, color='#ff8c6c', label='Line of Best Fit')
plt.xlabel('Field Goals Made')
plt.ylabel('Points')
plt.title('Field Goals Made vs Points')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```


    
![png](/assets/img/posts/2024-07-29-basketball-visualizations/output_43_0.png)
    


In this scatterplot, we can see a dense clump of players up until around 225 field goals made, and then a more spread out distribution of players with between 225 and 300 field goals made. There's also one player who scored more than 300 field goals in the season, represented as the single outlier in the far upper right corner of the graph. Let's identify that top player.

### View Top Players by Points
To see which players made the highest number of field goals in the season, we can use the pandas nlargest() function. By passing the arguments `5` and `FIELD_GOALS_MADE`, we can specify that we want to select the five rows with the highest value in the FIELD_GOALS_MADE column. 


```python
player_data.nlargest(5, 'FIELD_GOALS_MADE')[['PLAYER_NAME', 'TEAM_NAME', 'Class', 'Position', 'FIELD_GOALS_MADE']]
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {

    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {

      <td>Virginia Tech</td>
      <td>Senior</td>
      <td>Center</td>
      <td>278</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>294</th>
      <td>JuJu Watkins</td>
      <td>Indiana</td>

      <td>258</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



From this table, we can see that the player who made the most field goals in the season was Caitlin Clark. She scored 50+ additional field goals than Elizabeth Kitley, the player with the second highest number of field goals made. 

## Scatterplot of Minutes Played vs Points
Next, let's create a scatterplot to explored the relationship between the total minutes played and the total points scored by the player. As a reminder, the minutes played measures the time on the game clock that the player was one of the five teammates on the court. This does not include time on the bench or when the game clock is stopped (such as for free throws or halftime). 


```python
player_data.plot(x='MINUTES_PLAYED', y='POINTS', kind='scatter', title='Minutes Played vs Points')
plt.xlabel('Minutes Played')
plt.ylabel('Points Scored')
plt.show()
```


    
![png](/assets/img/posts/2024-07-29-basketball-visualizations/output_49_0.png)
    


## Box Plot of Height by Position

Next, letâ€™s take a look at a categorical value (position) compared to the playerâ€™s height. A box plot (a.k.a. box-and-whisker plot, candlestick chart) allows us to compare the height distribution of players across different positions in one visualization. Each box represents the [interquartile range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range) (the middle 50% of the height distribution for each position) with the line in the box indicating the [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) height. The length of the whiskers can vary depending on the method used, with the simplest method being to extend the whiskers to the highest and lowest data points. [Seabornâ€™s box plot documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/categorical.html#boxplots) mentions that the whiskers extend to the highest and lowest data points (height values) within 1.5 times the interquartile range of the upper and lower quartile, and any points beyond that are considered outliers.


```python
# Get the unique values in the "Position" column and sort alphabetically
position_order = sorted(player_data['Position'].unique())

# Create a box plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.boxplot(x='Position', y='Height', data=player_data, order=position_order)
plt.title('Height Distribution by Position')
plt.xlabel('Position')
plt.ylabel('Height (inches)')
plt.show()
```


    
![png](/assets/img/posts/2024-07-29-basketball-visualizations/output_52_0.png)
    


From the boxes on this plot, we can see that Centers are generally the tallest and Guards are generally the shortest players in this dataset. Forwards, on the other hand, have a smaller interquartile range in between Centers and Guards, and as a result have more outliers drawn on the plot. 

## Box Plot of Three Points Made by Conference
We can create another box plot that shows the number of three point field goals each player made by Conference. This gives us a high level overview of the distribution of successful three-pointers for players in each Conference. 


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.boxplot(x="Conference", y="THREE_POINTS_MADE", data=player_data, order=sorted(player_data['Conference'].unique()))
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.title('Three Points Made by Conference')
plt.show()
```


    
![png](/assets/img/posts/2024-07-29-basketball-visualizations/output_55_0.png)
    


This chart can also highlight issues with how data is distributed for each category. For example, the box-and-whiskers for the `DI Independent` conference is quite collapsed compared to the other conferences. This could indicate a lack of data for that conference, which we can verify using the panda's [groupby()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html) and [size()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.size.html) functions.


```python
player_data[player_data['THREE_POINTS_MADE'] > 0].groupby('Conference').size()
```




    Conference
    AAC               35
    ACC               37
    ASUN              16
    America East      12
    Atlantic 10       35
    Big 12            40
    Big East          28
    Big Sky           20
    Big South         15
    Big Ten           40
    Big West          24
    CAA               28
    CUSA              19
    DI Independent     1
    Horizon           22
    Ivy League        15
    MAAC              26
    MAC               23
    MEAC              10
    MVC               29
    Mountain West     25
    NEC               12
    OVC               22
    Pac-12            33
    Patriot           16
    SEC               41
    SWAC              18
    SoCon             11
    Southland         19
    Summit League     18
    Sun Belt          33
    WAC               26
    WCC               24
    dtype: int64



We can see that the DI Independent Conference only has one data point where the number of `THREE_POINTS_MADE` is greater than zero, which explains why the box in the chart above looks more like a single point. 

Also we can see that the Big Ten conference has an outlier with significantly more `THREE_POINTS_MADE` compared to any other data point. We can verify who that player is with the panda's [groupby()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html) and [max()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.max.html) functions.


```python
player_data.sort_values(by='THREE_POINTS_MADE', ascending=False)[['PLAYER_NAME', 'Conference', 'TEAM_NAME', 'THREE_POINTS_MADE']].head()

## Stacked Bar Chart of Rebound Type by Position

Next, let's take a look at how rebound type is distributed among different positions using a stacked bar chart. A stacked bar chart allows us to see the proportion of each rebound type (offensive and defensive) for each position. The height of each bar represents the total number of rebounds, while the colors represent the percentage distribution between offensive and defensive rebounds.


```python
# Group by "Position" and sum the rebound columns
grouped_rebounds = player_data.groupby('Position').agg({
    'OFFENSIVE_REBOUNDS': 'sum',
    'DEFENSIVE_REBOUNDS': 'sum',
    'TOTAL_REBOUNDS': 'sum'
})

# Create a stacked bar plot
ax = grouped_rebounds.plot(x=None, y=['OFFENSIVE_REBOUNDS', 'DEFENSIVE_REBOUNDS'], kind="bar", rot=0, stacked=True)
ax.set_title('Total Rebounds by Position')
ax.set_xlabel('Position')
ax.set_ylabel('Total Rebounds')
ax.legend(title='Rebound Type')
plt.show()
```

We can check the totals for each position and type of rebound by printing `grouped_rebounds`. 


```python
grouped_rebounds
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>OFFENSIVE_REBOUNDS</th>
      <th>DEFENSIVE_REBOUNDS</th>
      <th>TOTAL_REBOUNDS</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Position</th>
      <th></th>
      <th></th>
      <th></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Center</th>
      <td>3949</td>
      <td>7695</td>
      <td>11644</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Forward</th>
      <td>18305</td>
      <td>37903</td>
      <td>56208</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Guard</th>
      <td>16555</td>
      <td>53039</td>
      <td>69594</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



From the stacked bar chart, we can see that Centers have the lowest number of rebounds, both offensively and defensively. Guards have slightly more total rebounds than Forwards, and all three positions have more defensive rebounds than offensive rebounds. 

## Heatmap of Player Assists and Steals by Height

Next, let's create a heatmap using Seaborn's `heatmap()` function to visualize the relationship between a player's height and their number of steals and assists. Heatmaps are great for identifying patterns and trends in large datasets. To make patterns easier to see, we grouped assists and steals into bins. Once the data is binned, we can configure the heatmap to show assists on the x-axis, height on the y-axis, and steals as the color. 


```python
# Define bins
assist_bins = np.arange(0, player_data['ASSISTS'].max() + 1, 10)
player_data['Assist_Bin'] = pd.cut(player_data['ASSISTS'], bins=assist_bins)

# Create heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
heatmap_data = player_data.pivot_table(index='Assist_Bin', columns='Height', values='STEALS', aggfunc='sum', observed=False)
sns.heatmap(heatmap_data, cmap='Greens', linewidths=0.5, cbar_kws={'label': 'Steals'})
plt.title('Steals and Assists by Height')
plt.show()
```


    
![png](/assets/img/posts/2024-07-29-basketball-visualizations/output_68_0.png)
    


From this graph, we can see a general upward trend between height and assists. However, the number of steals is more clumped, with the highest number of steals in three separate spots.

## Violin Plot of Points by Class

A violin plot is particularly useful for visualizing the distribution of data points. It combines aspects of a box plot and a kernel density plot to show the distribution shape and spread of the data. Similar to the box plot, the violin plot shows the same interquartile range and median, but with the distribution (smoothed using the [kernel density estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimationhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation) method) plotted on either side. The width of each "violin" at each point, for example, would indicate how many players of that class scored that many total points in the season.

Let's use Seaborn's [violinplot() function](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.violinplot.htmlhttps://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.violinplot.html) to visualize the distribution of points scored by players across different classes (academic years).


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.violinplot(x="Class", y="POINTS", data=player_data, order=['Freshman', 'Sophomore', 'Junior', 'Senior'])
plt.title('Distribution of Points Scored by Class')
plt.show()
```


    
![png](/assets/img/posts/2024-07-29-basketball-visualizations/output_72_0.png)
    


From this plot, we can see that the shape of the distribution for each class is slightly different, but each one has a peak between 200 and 400 points. The Freshman and Senior distributions both have long "tails" at the top, but the top "tail" for the Senior distribution is both longer and thinner. Since it's so thin, perhaps the long upper tail for Seniors is being created by one player who scored substantially more points than any other Senior. Let's explore this by re-creating the violin plots but exclude Caitlin Clark from the dataset.


```python
violin_data = player_data.loc[player_data['PLAYER_NAME'] != 'Caitlin Clark']

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.violinplot(x="Class", y="POINTS", data=violin_data, order=['Freshman', 'Sophomore', 'Junior', 'Senior'])
plt.title('Distribution of Points Scored by Class excluding Caitlin Clark')
plt.show()
```


    
![png](/assets/img/posts/2024-07-29-basketball-visualizations/output_74_0.png)
    


From this new plot, we can see that the rest of the distributions are the same, but the long upper tail for Seniors has entirely disappeared. Unlike box plots, Seaborn violin plots do not represent outliers are separate dots, so that one data point (Caitlin Clark) was being represented in the distribution as a long upper tail. 

## Histogram of Fouls per Game

We can look at the distribution of average fouls per game using Seaborn's [histplot() function](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.histplot.htmlhttps://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.histplot.html). The `bins` parameter lets us specify how many bins we want the data grouped into, and the `kde` parameter allows us to add a [Kernel Density Estimate (KDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimationhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation) line to the graph. The KDE line shows a smoothed estimate of the data's distribution. 


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.histplot(player_data['FOULS_PER_GAME'], bins=30, kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of Fouls per Game')
plt.xlabel('Number of Fouls per Game')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()
```


    
![png](/assets/img/posts/2024-07-29-basketball-visualizations/output_78_0.png)
    


From this chart, we can see that most players averaged between 1.5 and 3.0 fouls per game over the entire season. The players at the left-most end of the graph averaged around half a foul per game (or one foul every other game) and the players at the right-most end of the graph averaged nearly four fouls per game (or nearly fouling out every single game). The peak of this distribution is between 2.0 and 2.5 fouls per game. 

## Joint Plot of Fantasy Points vs Turnovers

In this section, we'll create a joint plot to visualize the relationship between turnovers and fantasy points. This joint plot combines a scatter plot (including a regression line) with histograms to show the distribution and correlation of two variables. This will help us understand how the number of turnovers impacts the fantasy points scored by a player.


```python
sns.jointplot(x='TURNOVERS', y='FANTASY_POINTS', data=player_data, kind='reg', scatter_kws={'alpha': 0.5})
plt.subplots_adjust(top=0.9)
plt.suptitle('Fantasy Points vs Turnovers', fontsize=16)
plt.show()
```


    
![png](/assets/img/posts/2024-07-29-basketball-visualizations/output_82_0.png)
    


From the joint plot, we can see the scatter of data points representing the relationship between turnovers and fantasy points. The regression line helps us identify any potential correlation between these two variables.

# Wrap Up
Today's visualizations were primarily an exploration of various chart types and options that can be helpful. Which charts you want to include in your report will depend on your dataset, but it's generally a good idea to try out multiple chart types and variable pairings before deciding on which ones are best.

To summarize this project so far, we've built a new dataset by acquiring and then combining the NCAA women's basketball player information dataset with the Yahoo Sports player statistics dataset. We laid the groundwork for data analysis by cleaning and preprocessing the combined player data, and then expanded upon it by engineering a few new features. In this part, we took a closer look at the underlying data in each column and created visualizations to identify the relationship between various parameters. In the next article, we'll select, train, and evaluate a machine learning model.
