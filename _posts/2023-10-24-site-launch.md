The website for Pinecone Data is now live at [pineconedata.com](https://pineconedata.github.io). This website was built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static website generator, and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a website hosting solution that is built directly from your GitHub repository.
