Today we’ll break down the highlights of 2024 - from starting [my own business](/about/) to attending local conferences.
We'll cover new writing projects, interesting conferences and events (both local and online), supportive coding communities, continuous learning opportunities, as well as attainable goals for 2025.

# Writing

After writing two posts near the end of 2023, I added eight substantial posts to the roster in 2024, which is pretty solid considering I spent the first 3-4 months of the year working on a project that is yet to be released. Each of these posts, all part of a single [data science project](/2024-04-11-basketball-data-acquisition/#project-overview), has an associated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pineconedata/ncaa-basketball-stats) and took hours to write up. I'm proud of how they turned out!

# GitHub

![image.png](/assets/img/posts/2025-01-24-year-in-review-2024/github_activity.png)

It’s great to see 562 contributions on my GitHub profile this year! This number only reflects contributions to my public repositories and does not include any commits made to private repos, but it’s still a good indicator of my coding progress this year. I'm especially happy with maintaining this level of visible activity while balancing the rest of my workload and responsibilities.

# Conferences

I was fortunate to attend 4 major conferences this year, one of which was in person: 

- [Agents in Production Conference](https://home.mlops.community/public/events/aiagentsinprod), hosted by the [MLOps Community](https://home.mlops.community/), online.

# Continuous Learning

I focused on expanding my knowledge in machine learning and data science through a combination of books, online resources, and practical applications. Here are some highlights:

- [The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book](https://themlbook.com/)
- [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/)
- [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/)
- Individual chapters of several other books
- There are too many smaller resources on data science and software development that I used throughout the year for me to list each one individually, so I’ll simply add:
    - Hundreds of hours of podcast episodes
    - Hundreds of hours of YouTube videos
    - Hundreds of individual articles and tutorials

# Communities

I actively participated in several online tech communities, engaging in discussions, sharing knowledge, and learning from other professionals in the field. Here are the top three communities:

- Continued participating in the [MLOps Community](https://home.mlops.community/)
- Joined the [Women Coding Community](https://womencodingcommunity.com/)
- Joined the RVA Dev Community on Slack
- Joined a few smaller communities

# Challenges

I joined a public coding challenge for the first time. This one was hosted by the [Women Coding Community](https://womencodingcommunity.com/) during the month of December and was primarily managed through their Slack community. My individual progress was tracked through a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pineconedata/wcc-coding-challenge-24). The coding challenge was surprisingly fun and I would definitely participate in another one in the future! 

# Looking Forward

My recap of 2024 wouldn’t feel complete without a few rough goals for 2025: 

- Publish six articles
- Attend two conferences (at least one in-person, if possible)
- Join an event hosted by the PyRVA group
- Read three books
- Join a coding challenge

That wraps up my recap of 2024! I'm grateful for the opportunities to learn, grow, and connect with others in the tech community. While I always with there were more time, I’m happy with the progress made this year and am excited for the year ahead. Happy New Year!
