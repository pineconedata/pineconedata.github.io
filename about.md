Hi! I am a data scientist and physicist with 7+ years of experience in the field. Pinecone Data is my company for freelancing and contract-based work. If you're interested in working with me, please [get in touch](/contact)!

## Career Highlights

During my time as a Senior Data Scientist at a web performance company, I honed my skills in [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming, [SQL queries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), data manipulation, web scraping, and crafting insightful visualizations from unstructured data. I specialized in test case development with [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) and customizing data collection through lightweight [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) code compatible with modern browsers. I was responsible for [automating](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/crontab.5.html) scheduled reports, [optimizing data sets](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) for analysis, as well as making data both accessible and actionable.

In my role as an Implementation Manager at an equity management company, I managed end-to-end projects involving the migration of clients onto a new software platform via [ETL processes](https://www.ibm.com/topics/etl). This position demanded proficiency in developing and maintaining [SQL queries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) for individual databases, simultaneously managing multiple client projects, meticulous [data analysis]((https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)), comprehensive project documentation, as well as the provision of technical support and training to clients.

Before venturing into the private sector, I worked in the [Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Laboratory](https://ams.arizona.edu/) at the University of Arizona, where I played a crucial role in improving [radioisotope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionuclide) dating equipment. I also had the privilege of developing and hosting a [particle physics masterclass](https://home.cern/news/news/physics/find-higgs-boson-lhc-public-data) for local high school students. My educational background includes a B.S. in [Physics](https://w3.physics.arizona.edu/), providing a solid foundation for my data-driven career.
